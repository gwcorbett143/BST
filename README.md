This is the GitHub for the Binary Search Tree lab. 
Binary search trees work by storing data with keys based on the keys that data is paired with. It should be noted that what distinguishes a binary search tree from some other data structure like a dictionary is the fact that binary search trees organize data based on their keys.
This specific project has one class file, one node file, and one driver file to run the class file and the node file.
